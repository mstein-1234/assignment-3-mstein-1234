Here’s a little about me ~~(because they made me, I’m introverted, and I wouldn’t do it otherwise):~~

-   I’m a student of Soil and Crop Sciences and a professional excuse-inventor. Seriously, I could write a book.
-   My hobbies include: mastering the art of procrastination and collecting memes that may or may not be useful.
-   My secret superpower: making even the most boring tasks slightly entertaining… or sarcastically commenting on them.
-   Special skill: complaining about everything… in a creative and slightly dramatic way, of course.
